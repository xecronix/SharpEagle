## Description:
The Sharp Eagle Templating Solution (SETS) is capable of replacing a properly tagged text document with external data.  
This solution has the added advantage of being easily extended via the use of callbacks implemented as interfaces.  
Using callbacks a programmer can easily model recursive data and on the fly data translations.  Some use cases include 
translation of data from one format to another, generic templated documents, mail templates, and other similar tasks.  
The program is particularly well suited for translation of relational data to hierarchical visualizations.

## Testing:
This project has testing built in.  The tests provide several examples on using the templating system.
